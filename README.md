# MERN Stack REST API Server

Welcome to the MERN Stack REST API Server repository! This project serves as a learning resource for understanding the development of a RESTful API using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack. It includes CRUD operations, user authentication, JSON Web Token (JWT) implementation, user roles authorization, MongoDB as the database, Mongoose for ORM, and Express for routing.

## Features
- CRUD Operations: Perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations on data entities.
- User Authentication: Users can register, login, and manage their accounts securely.
- JWT Implementation: JSON Web Tokens are used for secure communication between client and server.
- User Roles Authorization: Different user roles (e.g., admin, regular user) have different access permissions.
- MongoDB Database: Utilizes MongoDB as the database to store data persistently.
- Mongoose ORM: Mongoose provides an elegant solution for managing interactions with the MongoDB database.
- Express Routing: Express.js is used for routing and handling HTTP requests.
